**fklearn** uses functional programming principles to make it easier to solve real problems with Machine Learning.

The name is a reference to the widely known [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

**fklearn Principles**

1. Validation should reflect real-life situations.
2. Production models should match validated models.
3. Models should be production-ready with few extra steps.
4. Reproducibility and in-depth analysis of model results should be easy to achieve.
