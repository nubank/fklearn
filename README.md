**fkit-learn** makes it easier to solve real business problems using Machine Learning. It largely relies on functional programming principles to help achieve this goal.

The name is a tribute to the widely known [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

**Fklearn Principles**

1. Models should be production-ready with few extra steps.
2. Validation should reflect real-life situations.
3. Production models should match validated models.
4. Reproducibility should be easily attainable.
5. In-depth analysis and interpretation of model results should be simple to do.
